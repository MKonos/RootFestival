Settings : 
1 brightness 25% 
2 2.3Ghz on big cores zzmoove on big, schedutil on little cores
3 turned off Samsung "smart" features and hotplugging
4 freezed half the bloatware in titanium backup.
5 black theme on everything
6 turned off edge
7 used Greenify + NapTime + Myandroid tools + app ops to save battery. 
8 medium power saving mode

We can estimate from the pictures that I will wnd up with 13~17H SoT

By comparison, Xceed with similar settings burns 8% battery for every hour. Meaning 12 hour SoT

Stock I was burning 13% every hour. Meaning 7.5H


spectrum balanced profile, then changed the following:

both CPU governors --> schedutil
cpu input boost --> OFF (0ms, 0 MHz)
IO scheduler --> maple, 2048kb readahead on internal, 4096kb on SD
