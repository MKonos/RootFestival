WiFi problems?
Try this:
Due to "securestorage" being set to true in build.prop, changes to the ROM or kernel that aren't reflected in the ss_id file in /system/etc/secure_storage/.system.bin.wpa_supplicant/ can cause issues with WiFi among other things. You can set this to false yourself, or simply flash the zip file below.

For those that prefer to do it manually, simply change this line ro.securestorage.support=true to false in /system/build.prop.
