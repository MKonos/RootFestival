How to install Analog Keyboard for Android Wear

1)  Make sure you have a recent Android SDK installed and have a working adb 
    connection to your watch: http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html
    
    For the Moto 360, which doesn't have a USB connector, you need to setup 
    Bluetooth debugging: https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/bt-debugging.html

-------------
enable debugging AND bt debugging on the moto 360
go to the android wear app and enable usb debugging in the settings
confirm any popups that appear asking for debugging permissions
adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub
adb connect localhost:4444
-------------
    
2)  Run "adb install com.microsoft.research.analogkeyboard-Signed.apk"
    (don't forget to specify "-s localhost:4444" if you're connected via Bluetooth)

    This will install the keyboard service, as well as a test app that shows up 
    as "Analog Keyboard" in your watch's "Start..." menu. The test app is 
    simply a dummy edit control that you can tap to bring up the keyboard.

--------------
adb -s localhost:4444 install analogkeyboard.apk

adb -s localhost:4444 shell ime enable com.microsoft.research.analogkeyboard/.KeyboardService

adb -s localhost:4444 shell ime set com.microsoft.research.analogkeyboard/.KeyboardService
--------------

3)  Run "adb -s localhost:4444 shell ime enable com.microsoft.research.analogkeyboard/.KeyboardService"

4)  Run "adb -s localhost:4444 shell ime set com.microsoft.research.analogkeyboard/.KeyboardService"

    This command starts up the service which can make the current foreground app
    unresponsive for a few (5-10) seconds (this happens only once, though).

5)  Invoke the keyboard by tapping on any text edit control.

Happy handwriting!
